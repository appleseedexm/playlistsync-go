# Playlist Sync 

## Description

A simple CLI to sync your spotify playlist to tidal. 

## Status

Super alpha, but it works. There's no CLI as of now, everything is hardcoded.

It's mostly a playground for me to play with go. Because I got stressed about getting playlists over the code is absolute trash.

## Requirements

- spotify developer account
- manually add tidal bearer token from browser

## Planned

- currently mismatches are not validated and it happens that some wrong songs are added
- code cleanup 
- cli output cleanup
- fix playlist naming

## Nice to have but probably never going to happen

- add cli support to select playlists
- add cli support to fix mismatches
- fix error handling
